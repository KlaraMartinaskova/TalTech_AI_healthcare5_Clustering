# Clustering
The goal of this task was to group subjects into clusters so that the clinic could later perform further EEG signal processing on these clusters. The clinic will look for objective symptoms that characterize the brain state of the subjects and can later be used to assess brain states without having to fill out lengthy subjective questionnaires. The questionnaire is likely to be used to derive parameters of physical health and psychological health.
I created the program in MATLAB 2020a. I comment the script called "Clustering_task" to show how I proceeded.
